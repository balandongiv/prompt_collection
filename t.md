once complete, rerun the
tutorial/14_strategy_e_autoreject_drop_threshold.py

one for median, and for mean
Update `pyblinker/strategy_f/blink_threshold.py` to support **two threshold-center strategies** for blink-threshold estimation from the same flagged/rejected epochs:

1. **median-based center**
2. **mean-based center**

### Goal

Refactor the current threshold calculation so the center calculation is moved into a **dedicated helper function**, while preserving the current median-based behavior and adding a mean-based alternative for experimentation.

The current logic is:

```python
samples = prepared.data[source_indices, channel_idx, :].reshape(-1)
center = float(np.median(samples))
dispersion = float(SCALING_FACTOR * mad(samples))
thresholds[channel_name] = center + float(std_threshold) * dispersion
centers[channel_name] = center
dispersions[channel_name] = dispersion
```

### Required changes

#### 1. Create a dedicated function

Add a helper function in `pyblinker/strategy_f/blink_threshold.py` that computes the threshold statistics from a 1D sample array.

Suggested name:

```python
compute_channel_threshold_statistics(...)
```

or

```python
compute_threshold_from_samples(...)
```

The function should:

* accept a 1D `samples` array
* accept `std_threshold`
* accept a strategy selector such as `center_method` with allowed values:

  * `"median"`
  * `"mean"`
* return:

  * `center`
  * `dispersion`
  * `threshold`

Use:

* `np.median(samples)` for the median strategy
* `np.mean(samples, dtype=np.float64)` for the mean strategy
* `SCALING_FACTOR * mad(samples)` for dispersion in both cases

#### 2. Add validation

If `center_method` is not one of the supported values, raise a clear `ValueError`.

#### 3. Refactor existing threshold loop

Update the existing per-channel threshold calculation to call the new helper instead of computing the statistics inline.

Preserve existing output structures such as:

* `thresholds[channel_name]`
* `centers[channel_name]`
* `dispersions[channel_name]`

#### 4. Keep backward compatibility

Default behavior should remain the current one unless there is already a config pattern in this module that suggests otherwise.

Recommended default:

* `center_method="median"`

#### 5. Add detailed docstrings

Add a detailed docstring to the new helper function explaining:

* what the function computes
* what `samples` represents
* what `center_method` does
* why `median + MAD` is more robust
* why `mean + MAD` may be useful for comparison
* what is returned
* what exceptions are raised

The docstring should clearly explain this design intent:

* **median-based approach**

  * less affected by blink peaks
  * MAD is also robust
  * threshold is more stable

* **mean-based approach**

  * more sensitive to large positive blink peaks
  * often produces a higher threshold on skewed blink-heavy data
  * useful for experimentation and comparison with older behavior

#### 6. Add or update tests

Add tests for the new helper and the refactored logic.

Minimum test coverage:

* median mode returns expected center/dispersion/threshold
* mean mode returns expected center/dispersion/threshold
* invalid `center_method` raises `ValueError`
* median and mean produce different thresholds on skewed sample data
* default mode remains median

Use a toy skewed example where mean and median differ clearly.

Example kind of input:

```python
samples = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 10, 12], dtype=float)
```

### Documentation task

Create a markdown document explaining the difference between the two approaches.

Suggested filename:

* `paper/autoreject_epoch_find_blink/blink-threshold-center-methods.md`

If the repo has an established docs location or naming convention, follow that instead.

### Markdown content requirements

Explain:

#### What both methods have in common

Both compute:

* a center
* a robust dispersion using `1.4826 * MAD`
* a threshold as:

```text
threshold = center + std_threshold * dispersion
```

#### Median-based center

Explain:

* median is less affected by blink peaks
* MAD is also robust
* threshold is more stable
* recommended when flagged epochs contain strong blink outliers
* better when robustness is more important than strictness

#### Mean-based center

Explain:

* mean is pulled upward by large blink peaks
* on blink-heavy flagged samples, this often yields a higher threshold
* more conservative, may miss smaller blinks
* useful when comparing to older MATLAB-like or legacy behavior

#### Practical consequence

Explain that:

* median-based threshold usually detects more blink regions
* mean-based threshold usually detects fewer, more conservative regions

#### Include a small numeric example

Use a small example such as:

```text
samples = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 10, 12]
median = 1.5
mean = 3.5
```

Then explain how the threshold differs if the same MAD-scaled dispersion is used.

### Coding style guidance

* keep the helper small and focused
* do not duplicate threshold logic between median and mean branches more than necessary
* use explicit variable names: `center`, `dispersion`, `threshold`
* prefer clear readability over compact cleverness

### Deliverables

1. Refactored `pyblinker/strategy_f/blink_threshold.py`
2. New helper function with detailed docstring
3. Tests for both strategies
4. New markdown doc explaining mean vs median thresholding

### Acceptance criteria

The task is complete when:

* the file supports both `"median"` and `"mean"` center strategies
* current behavior remains unchanged by default
* tests pass
* the markdown clearly explains when to use mean vs median
* the code makes it easy to experiment with the two approaches later
